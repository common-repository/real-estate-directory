The real estate directory add-on for GeoDirectory adds extra real estate functionality to your real estate website, such as a walk score, mortgage calculator, Virtual Tour custom field, and energy rating charts.  

== Description ==

This plugin adds real estate functionality and blocks to your real estate website built with [GeoDirectory](https://wordpress.org/plugins/geodirectory/). It works best when combined with the free [WordPress Real Estate Listings Theme](https://wordpress.org/themes/real-estate-listings/) for GeoDirectory. 

**WalkScore.com Block**
Our GD > Walk Score block relies on third-party services from [walkscore.com](https://www.walkscore.com). When used, the block embeds an iframe on the page.
Please refer to the WalkScore's service [Terms of Use and Privacy Policy](https://www.walkscore.com/tile-terms-of-use.shtml).

**Virtual Tour Custom Field**
Our Virtual Tour custom field lets you embed services such as matterport.com. Our demo data uses matterport.com examples, which render data from the third-party matterport.com website.
Please refer to the matterport.com [Term of Use](https://matterport.com/terms-of-use).
